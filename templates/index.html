                            Johnson’s algorithm is used to find the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in a directed graph.
                            We convert negative edge weights into non-negative edge weights.
                            It does this by using the Bellman-Ford algorithm to remove all negative weights.
                            It then allows Dijkstra’s algorithm to be used on the new graph reweighted graph.
                            Dijkstra’s algorithm is applied to new graph by taking each node as the source vertex.

                            The all-pairs shortest path problem is used to determine the shortest graph 
                            distances between every pair of vertices in a given graph.
                            It aims to figure out the shortest path from each vertex (v) to every other vertex (u) in the graph.

                                Johnson’s algorithm can be used to find shortest distance

                                Johnson’s algorithm works better than Floyd-Warshall algorithm to find shortest path between 
                                all pairs of vertices in cases where the graph is a sparse graph.

                            The main steps in the algorithm are Bellman Ford Algorithm called once and Dijkstra called V times.
                            Where V is the number of vertices/nodes and E is the number of edges in the graph.
                            Time complexity of Bellman Ford is <b>O(VE)</b> and time complexity of Dijkstra is <b>O(VLogV) </b> (Using Fibonacci heap). 
                            So overall time complexity is <b>O(V<sup>2</sup> log V + VE)</b>.
                            The time complexity of Johnson's algorithm becomes same as Floyd Warshell when the graphs is complete (For a complete graph E = O(V<sup>2</sup>). 
                            But for sparse graphs, the algorithm performs much better than Floyd Warshell.
